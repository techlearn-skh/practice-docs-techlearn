Learning Path (Recommended Order)

	S3 â†’ EC2 â†’ RDS â†’ IAM (foundation)

	Elastic Beanstalk â†’ CloudWatch

	ECS or EKS â†’ API Gateway â†’ Lambda

	SQS/SNS â†’ DynamoDB â†’ Secrets Manager

	CI/CD â†’ CloudFormation/CDK

	Advanced (MSK, X-Ray, WAF, etc.)

Tools & SDKs Youâ€™ll Actually Use as a Java Dev

	AWS SDK for Java v2

	Spring Cloud AWS (for seamless integration)

	AWS CLI (to automate tasks)

	Terraform / AWS CDK (for IaC)

	Docker (for ECS/EKS)



-----------------------------------------------------------------
Core Services (Must Learn)
1. Compute Services
	AWS Lambda: Serverless Java functions (perfect for microservices, APIs)

	AWS Fargate: Serverless containers for Spring Boot apps

	Amazon EC2: Traditional VM deployment

	Elastic Beanstalk: PaaS for easy Java app deployment

2. Database Services
	Amazon RDS: Managed relational databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL) for Spring apps

	Amazon DynamoDB: NoSQL for high-performance applications

	Amazon Aurora: High-performance MySQL/PostgreSQL compatible

3. Storage Services
	Amazon S3: Object storage for files, images, backups

	Amazon EBS: Block storage for EC2 instances

ðŸ¥ˆ Application Development Services
4. API & Application Services
	Amazon API Gateway: REST APIs for your Lambda/EC2 applications

	AWS App Runner: Fully managed container deployment

	Elastic Load Balancing: Distribute traffic to your Java apps

	5. Messaging & Event-Driven Architecture
	Amazon SQS: Message queuing for decoupled microservices

	Amazon SNS: Pub/Sub messaging

	Amazon EventBridge: Event bus for event-driven applications

ðŸ¥‰ Developer Tools & DevOps
6. Development & Deployment
	AWS SDK for Java 2.x: Programmatic access to AWS services

	AWS CodeBuild: Build your Java applications

	AWS CodeDeploy: Automated deployments

	AWS CodePipeline: CI/CD pipelines

ðŸŽ¯ Java-Specific AWS Integratio

---------------------------------------------
VPC:
 Internet Gate Ways IGW.
 Route Tables.
 NACl - Network Access Control Lists. NACLs are stateless. NACL always applied on subnet level.
 Subnets. [1 subnet === 1 Availability Zone]
 Firewall Security Groups.
